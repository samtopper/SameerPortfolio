# Sameer's Portfolio.

This portfolio describes the technical blogs I maintain.
This project is part of my Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity.

## How to use.

* Click this [link](https://samtopper.github.io/SameerPortfolio/) for the webpage or download the repository to your local machine & open index.html in your browser.

* Click the C++, Java & Python icons to open a modal which has a little more description & a link to my blog.

* The bottom social media icons will redirect to the respective page.

* The 'cat' image at center is just a placeholder, I will update with some of my other works there.

* After loading the webpage if the central cat image & social media icons are not displayed then you have allow loading them by clicking 'load unsafe scripts' present at right side of the search bar.

* This portfolio is under development, if you have any good suggestion for improving it I will be happy to know them.
